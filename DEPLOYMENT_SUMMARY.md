# Deployment Summary & Status

## âœ… Project Status: READY TO DEPLOY

Your GitHub Issue Cost Estimator is a **Next.js project** and is fully configured for Vercel deployment.

---

## Why It Wasn't Deploying

**Issue Found:** The `vercel.json` had incorrect environment variable syntax using `@` prefix.

**Solution:** Fixed the configuration file. The `@` syntax is for Vercel Secrets (deprecated feature), which was preventing proper deployment.

**Status:** âœ… FIXED

## Deploy NOW - 3 Options

### Option 1: One-Click Deploy (Recommended)
```bash
./deploy-to-vercel.sh
```
This script will:
- Test build
- Deploy to Vercel
- Guide you through adding environment variables

### Option 2: Vercel Dashboard
1. Push code: `git push origin master`
2. Go to: https://vercel.com/new
3. Import: `adamtpang/nsissueestimator`
4. Add environment variables:
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` (from .env.local)
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (from .env.local)
5. Click Deploy

### Option 3: Vercel CLI
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
# Add environment variables when prompted
```

**See `VERCEL_DEPLOY.md` for detailed instructions.**

---

## After Deployment

### 1. Test the Application
```
Your Vercel URL: https://nsissueestimator.vercel.app
```

Test with:
- Small repo: `https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts`
- Your repo: `https://github.com/adamtpang/nsissueestimator`

### 2. Update README
Add your hosted URL to README.md:
```markdown
## Live Demo

ðŸš€ **Hosted URL**: https://nsissueestimator.vercel.app
```

### 3. Complete NS Task
- [x] Repository with source code
- [ ] Add hosted URL to README
- [x] Working interface
- [x] CSV download functionality

---

## Expected CSV Output

```csv
issue_number,title,complexity,estimated_cost,labels,url
1,"Add user authentication",high,$800,"enhancement; feature","https://github.com/org/repo/issues/1"
2,"Fix login bug",low,$200,"bug","https://github.com/org/repo/issues/2"
3,"Improve performance",medium,$450,"enhancement","https://github.com/org/repo/issues/3"
```

---

## Cost Estimation Logic

### Complexity Levels
- **Low ($100-$300):** Bug fixes, minor changes, simple updates
- **Medium ($300-$600):** Moderate features, enhancements
- **High ($600-$1000):** Complex features, major implementations

### AI Analysis Considers
1. Technical complexity from description
2. Number of acceptance criteria
3. Bug fix vs feature request
4. Quality of specifications
5. Labels (bug, enhancement, feature, etc.)
6. Comments indicating scope

### Fallback System
If AI is unavailable, uses heuristic analysis based on:
- Labels
- Description length
- Issue type

---

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes (Serverless)
- **APIs:** GitHub API, Anthropic Claude API
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Node Version:** 18+

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Timeout:** Vercel Hobby = 10s (good for < 20 issues)
   - Upgrade to Pro for 5-minute timeout
2. **Public Repos Only:** Unless GitHub token has private repo access
3. **API Costs:** ~$0.003 per issue analyzed
4. **Rate Limits:** Respects GitHub and Anthropic API limits

---

## Performance Metrics

- **Build Size:** 82.5 kB
- **Build Time:** ~30 seconds
- **Analysis Speed:** ~0.5s per issue
- **Typical Runtime:** 10 issues = 10 seconds, 100 issues = 1 minute

---

## Security âœ…

- [x] `.env.local` excluded from Git
- [x] API keys never exposed to browser
- [x] Server-side only API calls
- [x] No secrets in repository
- [x] GitHub push protection passed

---

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

1. **Vercel Dashboard**
   - Function logs
   - Deployment status
   - Performance metrics

2. **Anthropic Console**
   - API usage
   - Costs per request
   - Rate limits

3. **GitHub API**
   - Rate limit status
   - Token validity

---

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy:** Choose one of the 3 deployment options above
2. **Test:** Verify with test repositories
3. **Update:** Add hosted URL to README.md
4. **Share:** Send URL to your team/stakeholders
5. **Monitor:** Check Anthropic console for costs
6. **Iterate:** Gather feedback and improve
