# Deployment Checklist âœ“

Use this checklist to ensure everything is ready before deploying.

## Pre-Deployment

### Local Setup
- [x] Dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- [x] `.env.local` created with API keys
- [x] Build successful (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Tested locally (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Tested with a real GitHub repository
- [ ] CSV download works correctly
- [ ] Error handling works (try invalid URL)

### Code Quality
- [x] All files created
- [x] No syntax errors
- [x] API endpoint configured correctly
- [x] Environment variables properly set
- [x] `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files
- [x] Documentation complete

### API Keys
- [x] GitHub token obtained
- [x] Anthropic API key obtained
- [x] Keys added to `.env.local`
- [ ] Keys tested and working
- [ ] Keys have sufficient permissions

## Deployment Steps

### Option A: Vercel CLI

- [ ] Vercel CLI installed (`npm install -g vercel`)
- [ ] Run `vercel` command
- [ ] Add environment variables when prompted
- [ ] Verify deployment URL works
- [ ] Test with real repository

### Option B: GitHub + Vercel Dashboard

- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Repository connected to Vercel
- [ ] Environment variables added in Vercel dashboard:
  - [ ] `GITHUB_TOKEN` added
  - [ ] `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` added
- [ ] Deployment successful
- [ ] Deployment URL accessible

## Post-Deployment

### Testing
- [ ] Open deployment URL
- [ ] UI loads correctly
- [ ] Form validation works
- [ ] Test with small repo (< 20 issues)
- [ ] CSV downloads successfully
- [ ] Summary statistics display correctly
- [ ] Error handling works (test with invalid URL)

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with live URL
- [ ] Share deployment URL with stakeholders
- [ ] Document any issues encountered

### Monitoring
- [ ] Check Vercel dashboard for function logs
- [ ] Monitor Anthropic API usage
- [ ] Check GitHub API rate limit status
- [ ] Verify no errors in production logs

## Known Limitations

- [ ] Aware of 10s timeout on Hobby plan
- [ ] Understand API costs (~$0.003 per issue)
- [ ] Know GitHub rate limits (5000 req/hour)
- [ ] Tested with appropriate repo sizes

## Test Repositories

Use these to verify functionality:

### âœ“ Quick Test (< 10 issues)
- [ ] `https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts`

### âœ“ Medium Test (20-50 issues)
- [ ] `https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python`

### âœ“ Large Test (100+ issues - requires Pro plan)
- [ ] `https://github.com/vercel/next.js`

## Troubleshooting Completed

If issues arise, check:
- [ ] Vercel function logs
- [ ] Browser console for errors
- [ ] Environment variables in Vercel
- [ ] API key validity
- [ ] TROUBLESHOOTING.md

## Final Verification

- [ ] Application runs end-to-end
- [ ] CSV format is correct
- [ ] Cost estimates seem reasonable
- [ ] UI is responsive on mobile
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Loading states work properly

## Optional Enhancements

Future improvements to consider:
- [ ] Add analytics tracking
- [ ] Implement caching for results
- [ ] Add progress bar for large repos
- [ ] Support custom cost ranges
- [ ] Add authentication
- [ ] Export to additional formats (JSON, Excel)
- [ ] Store analysis history
- [ ] Add filtering by labels

## Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

âœ… Users can enter a GitHub URL
âœ… Issues are fetched from GitHub
âœ… AI analyzes complexity correctly
âœ… CSV downloads automatically
âœ… Summary statistics display
âœ… Errors are handled gracefully
âœ… Performance is acceptable

## Ready to Launch?

If all core items are checked, you're ready to deploy! ðŸš€

Run:
```bash
# Test locally first
./test-local.sh

# Then deploy
vercel
```

Or follow the GitHub + Vercel dashboard approach in DEPLOYMENT.md.

## Post-Launch

After deployment:
1. Share the URL
2. Gather user feedback
3. Monitor API costs
4. Fix any issues
5. Consider enhancements

**Good luck with your deployment!** ðŸŽ‰
